## There are few Best NoSQL database

#### Redis Database Management System
===================================

Redis is an open source in-memory data structure server and NoSQL database.
Redis is great at reducing your reliance on SQL and the cost associated with running a SQL infrastructure. That's why we have been able to scale out and improve performance on database requests and it's also easy to set up and implement.

### Why we use it ?
1. Great reliability and great fail over capabilities
1. Easy to set up, implement and deploy
1. Can scale as we grow
1. Backups to AWS S3 are supported and are very easy to set up

#### MongoDB Database Management System
=====================================

Mongo DB is better placed in large projects, with great scalability. It also allows you to work quite comfortably with projects based on programming languages such as javascript angular typescript C #. I believe that its performance is much better with the type of technologies that handle very logical, similar terms of programming. If we use languages like java php, for example, it is better to work with relational databases like postgres or mySql. Since this type of technology allows you to work better with database management frameworks much more agile for these environments, such as JPA, HIBERNATE, Oracle, I think they are much better with this type of architecture and programming languages.

### Why we use it ?
1. Being a JSON language optimizes the response time of a query, you can directly build a query logic from the same service
1. You can install a local, database-based environment rather than the non-relational real-time bases such a firebase does not allow, the local environment is paramount since you can work without relying on the internet.
1. Forming collections in Mango is relatively simple, you do not need to know of query to work with it, since it has a simple graphic environment that allows you to manage databases for those who are not experts in console management.

#### Amazon DynamoDB Database Management System
============================================

Amazon DynamoDB is an excellent tool that is used by the software development department, and web development has allowed us to develop applications and web pages, serverless, quickly and easily with a high level of performance, very fast and secure connection, It has been quite useful for us to implement NoSQL databases, and it is excellent for scalable projects, since we can increase memory resources as they are needed. It is quite comfortable and easy to work, since its confuration is simple, and it integrates easily with the entire aws environment.

### Why we use it ?
1. Serverless webapps, mobile apps, all backend storage.
2. Scalable proyects.
3. Low latency, high performance.
4. High level of security with real-time encryption.
5. Great capacity for compression of information backup.
6. Store information with high performance algorithms, in B trees and hashing.

#### IBM Cloudant Database Management System
========================================

IBM Cloudant is generally a good tool for a NonSQL, document oriented Database as a Service. It is very scalable and reliable, and managed services through IBM seems to be working well. You can consider as almost no lock-in since it is based on CouchDB API structures and you can migrate to any other provider in the future if needed. If you need real Global Availability, like Asia / China you may need to look for alternatives.

### Why we use it ?

1. For us, performance and scalability is the key, and Cloudant DB backed by CouchDB is scalable and performant.
1. IBM Cloudant dB is very easy to provision for sandbox, development, QA as well as production.
1. Support for Java for CouchDB app server analytics enables a greater control for over developers.

#### Cassandra Database Management System
=====================================

Cassandra is currently used for our enterprise eCommerce platform. So far our experience is good with Cassandra its an extremely powerful NoSQL Database with high performanceâ€”distributed, scalable, and highly available database platform.

### Why we use it ?
1. Continuous data availability is an extremely powerful feature of Cassandra.
1. Overall cost-effective and low maintenance database platform.
1. High performance and low tolerance no SQL database.
